This repo contains jupyter notebooks and slurm scripts that use my [jetutils](https://github.com/hbanderier/Jetutils) package to create the analyses and plots present in [my first preprint](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3029) as well as my upcoming works.

If any of this is useful to you, I would appreciate if you could cite me.
